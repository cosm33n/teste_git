  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    With a glut of burstingly ripe tomatoes, Michel cooks a super-smooth
    veloute. And in his own herb garden, makes a basil and garlic "pistou" to
    accompany it.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1.5kg ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 large red pepper, diced</li>
    <li>A generous pinch of piment d'espelette</li>
    <li>500ml vegetable stock</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper to season</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Add the olive oil to a large non stick sauté pan and heat over a medium heat. Add the onions and garlic to the pan and sauté for  3-4 minutes until softened. Add the tomatoes and pepper to the pan and continue to cook for 4 minutes. Add piment d'espelette and vegetable stock and bring up to a gentle simmer. Cook for 15-20 minutes.  
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile place ½ the basil and garlic into a pestle and mortar and add half the olive oil and pound until course. Add the remaining basil and olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Add the piment d'esplette and lemon zest and pound again until smooth. 
    </li>
    <li>Once the tomatoes have softened and the soup has thickened a little, blend until smooth with a stick blender. Taste again and add a little more seasoning if needed.    </li>
    <li>Ladle into bowls and top with a generous amount of pistou. Serve with crunchy bread. The great thing about this soup is that it’s equally delicious hot or cold.</li>
