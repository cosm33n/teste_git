  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Known in India as murgh makhana, butter chicken gets its name from the
    delicious spiced tomato and butter (or ghee) sauce that coats the chicken.
    Every restaurant in India has its own version; here's mine - a little sweet
    and a little spicy but mild enough for all tastes. It's full of flavour and
    after just a little prep, the dish simmers away and looks after itself.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>250g Greek style yoghurt</li>
    <li>4cm piece of ginger</li>
    <li>1 tsp grama masala</li>
    <li>1 tsp gorund cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp turmenic</li>
    <li>1 tsp sweet paprika</li>
    <li>1 tps salt</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Put all the marinade ingredients in a large bowl and mix well to combine.
      Add the halved chicken thighs and stir well so that all the chicken is
      coated in the spiced yogurt mixture. Leave to marinate for around 30
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven with grill to 200C fan.</li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, make the curry sauce. Place a large non-stick pan over a high
      heat and add the butter or ghee. When it has melted, add the onion and
      cook for 7-8 minutes, stirring regularly, until the onion begins to
      caramelise. Next add the cardamom, cinnamon stick, ginger and garlic and
      stir for 1-2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low before adding the
      remaining spices and salt. Stir well for another 1-2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in the tomato puree and cook for a further minute, then add the
      passata, single cream, boiling water and the fenugreek leaves. Bring the
      sauce to a simmer and cook gently for 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, take two large oven trays and place a cooling rack on each one.
      Once the chicken has marinated, lay the pieces of chicken on both racks.
      Place one tray under the grill for 10-12 minutes or until the chicken is
      cooked and browned well. Repeat with the second tray. When the chicken is
      cool enough to handle, gently remove it from the racks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring the curry sauce back up to a simmer and place the chicken pieces in.
      Stir well and cook for a further 5 minutes. Taste the sauce for seasoning
      and add a little sugar to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes if you
      like.
